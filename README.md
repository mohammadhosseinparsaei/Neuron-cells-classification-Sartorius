# Sartorius cell classification with Convolutional neural network (CNN)

In this project, I tried to classify different neurons cells named `shsy5y`, `astro` and `cort` with CNN deep learning. The data used in this learning consists of the images in the `train` file and the csv file named `train` that was downloaded from [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/sartorius-cell-instance-segmentation/data). The code is written in a Jupyter file in a very simple way. In addition, the weights of the trained model have also been uploaded in this repository.
